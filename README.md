## üîç Project Objectives

- **Customer Segmentation** using RFM analysis and k-means clustering.
- **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Prediction** with logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost.
- **Market Basket Analysis** to identify cross-sell opportunities via association rules mining (Apriori algorithm).
- **Next Purchase Prediction** to support customer retention and campaign timing.
